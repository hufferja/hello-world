My first repository
Hello, I'm Jeramy, yeap Jeramy with an A. I guess that makes me uniquely different. 
I'm a retired Navy veteran after 20 years of serving my country.
I've been to 17 different countries, been on 5 deployments to the Persain Gulf.
After completing graphic design and web design school I am continuing my education in coding. 
I am currently taking the Harvard CS50 course and learning as much as I can.
My next goal is learning Javascript.
